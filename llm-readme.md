# OpenManus Desktop - Project Context for LLMs

## Project Overview

OpenManus Desktop is a graphical user interface application that wraps the OpenManus AI agent framework. The project aims to transform OpenManus from a command-line tool into a full-featured desktop experience accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

### Core OpenManus Features
- Open-source AI agent framework
- Uses LLM capabilities to process user prompts
- Supports various flow types for different processing methods
- Built by contributors from MetaGPT

## Project Goals

1. **Accessibility**: Make OpenManus accessible to users without command-line experience
2. **Enhanced Productivity**: Provide visual tools and workflows that improve efficiency
3. **Extensibility**: Create a plugin architecture for additional capabilities
4. **Cross-Platform**: Support Windows, macOS, and Linux environments
5. **Professional UX**: Deliver a polished, intuitive user interface

## Technical Foundation

- **Frontend**: PyQt6-based desktop application
- **Backend**: Integration with existing OpenManus Python codebase
- **Architecture**: MVC pattern with event-driven design
- **Threading**: Background task execution for responsive UI
- **Data Management**: Local storage for sessions and configuration

## Core Feature Set

1. **Prompt Interface**: Rich text input for crafting prompts
2. **Flow Selection**: Visual selection of processing flow types
3. **Real-Time Output**: Display agent responses with formatting
4. **Task Management**: Run, monitor, and cancel tasks
5. **Session Management**: Save and load conversation contexts
6. **Configuration**: Manage API keys and model preferences

## Development Roadmap

The project follows a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Basic UI implementation
- OpenManus backend integration
- Flow type selection
- Log/output display
- Basic task management

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience
- Prompt management (templates, history)
- Theme customization
- Visualization tools
- Context/session management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Configuration and settings panel
- Plugin system
- Multi-agent support
- File and content management

### Phase 4: Distribution and Ecosystem
- Installers for all platforms
- Auto-update mechanism
- Cloud sync capabilities
- Collaboration features

### Phase 5: Expansion
- Mobile companion app
- API for third-party integration
- Advanced workflow tools
- Data analysis capabilities

## Target Audiences

1. **Technical Professionals**: Users familiar with AI concepts who prefer GUIs over CLIs
2. **Non-Technical Users**: People who want to use AI agents without technical expertise
3. **Developers**: Those looking to build on or extend the OpenManus platform

## Implementation Considerations

- **Performance**: Responsive UI with efficient background processing
- **Security**: Safe storage of API keys and sensitive data
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with accessibility standards
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery

## Project Status

The project is currently in initial development with focus on creating the core application structure and UI components. The priority is establishing the integration layer between the UI and the OpenManus backend.

## Key Differentiators

- **Open Source**: Fully open-source desktop interface for AI agents
- **Native Performance**: Desktop application with native performance
- **Visualization**: Rich visual tools for understanding agent operations
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for customization and extension
- **Privacy-First**: Local processing with no unnecessary data sharing

## Potential Challenges

- Maintaining compatibility with OpenManus core as it evolves
- Creating an intuitive UI that balances simplicity and power
- Supporting cross-platform deployment effectively
- Managing resource consumption for complex AI tasks
- Building a robust plugin architecture that's secure

## Success Metrics

- User adoption rate compared to CLI version
- Reduction in time to complete common tasks
- User satisfaction and retention metrics
- Community engagement and contributions
- Plugin ecosystem growth
