4. **Modern Component Architecture**: Clean separation of UI components, controllers, and models
5. **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Background processing to maintain UI responsiveness

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: PyQt6-based desktop application with custom styling
- **Backend Integration**: Python bridge to OpenManus framework
- **Data Flow**: TaskController mediates between UI and OpenManus agents
- **Threading Model**: Background execution of agent tasks with proper signaling
- **Component Structure**: Modular design with reusable UI components
